# smart-meter-benchmark

This GitHub repository was developed to create a benchmark tool for assessing the suitability of time series databases, key-value stores and document databases. Each database has dedicated notebooks to insert and query data. Also, every database type owns an abstraction layer with which database-specific commands can be reused and re-executed in a simplified manner.
